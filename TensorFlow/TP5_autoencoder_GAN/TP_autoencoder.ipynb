    "# Part 1 : Dimensionality Reduction with PCA and Autoencoders\n",

    "## Dimension Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will get hands-on experience with dimension reduction using two separate techniques: Priciple Component Analysis and Undercomplete Autoencoders.  The goal of dimension reduction is to find a suitable transformation which converts a large dimensional space into a smaller feature space, such that the important information is not lost. We've have seen these methods in class and we'll today apply them to MNIST dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The MNIST Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the MNIST digits dataset throughout this excercise.  The MNIST dataset provides 60000 28x28 pixel grayscale training images of hand-written digits 0-9.  The images are labeled with integer values 0-9.  The training set has become the defacto image classification example due to its small size.  For example, [follow the link](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/) to see how to build a digit classifier with TensorFlow in less than 20 lines of code!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this excercise, we are not interested in classifying images of digits.  Instead, we will think of the images as defining a 28x28 = 784 element feature space.  In this context, we are interested in transforming the 784 parameters into a smaller set of transformed coordinates.  Before continuing to the next section, use the keras datasets module to load the MNIST dataset and get to know how it is structured.\n",

    "## Principle Component Analysis (PCA)\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of PCA is to perform an orthogonal transformation which converts a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables, called _principle components_.  This can be thought of as fitting an n-dimensional ellipsoid to the observations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a dataset $X\\in R^{n\\times p}$, where $n$ is the number of observations and $p$ the number of variables.  PCA transforms $X$ into a new coordinate system (new variable set), such that the greatest variance in the data is captured in the first coordinate, and then the second, and so on.  More specifically, the transformed coordinates $T \\in R^{n\\times p}$ are written as a linear combination of the original dataset,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ T = X W, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $W \\in R^{p\\times p}$ is the transformation matrix.  The first column of $W$, denoted as $w_1$, is constructed to maximize the variance of the transformed coordinates.\n",

    "$$ w_1 = \\underset{\\|w\\|=1}{\\operatorname{argmax}} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (t_1)_i^2 = \\underset{\\|w\\|=1}{\\operatorname{argmax}} \\| X w \\|_2^2 = \\underset{\\|w\\|=1}{\\operatorname{argmax}} \\frac{w^T X^T X w}{w^T w} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The ratio in the last term is known as the _Rayleigh quotient_.  It is well known that for the positive, semidefinite matrix $X^T X$, the largest value of the Rayleigh quotient is given as the largest eigenvalue of the matrix, where $w$ is eigenvector associated with that eigenvalue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining columns of $W$ can be found by finding the the next orthogonal linear combination which maximizes the variance of the data, minus the previously transformed coordinates.\n",

    "where $\\Sigma \\in R^{n\\times p}$ is a rectangular diagonal matrix of positive values known as the the singular values, of $X$, $\\sigma(X)$, and $U \\in R^{n\\times n}$ and $W \\in R^{p\\times p}$ are orthonormal matrices, whose columns are the left and right (respectively) singular vectors of the matrix $X$.  Using this decomposition, we can easily see that\n",

    "$$ X^T X = W \\hat{\\Sigma} W^T, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\hat{\\Sigma}$ is a square diagonal matrix of the squared singular values of $X$.  Comparing this to the eigenvalue decomposition of $X^T X = Q \\Lambda Q^T$, we see that the singular values of $X$ represent the square-root of the eigenvalues of $X^T X$, and the singular vectors of $X$ are simply the eigenvectors of $X^T X$.  Therefore, we can compute perform PCA on a data matrix $X$ by computing its right singular vector matrix, $W$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimensionality Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We can reduce the dimensionality of our data by truncating the transformed variables to include only a subset of those variables with the highest variance.  For example, if we keep the first $L <= p$ variables, the reduced transformation reads\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ T_L = X W_L, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $W_L \\in R^{n\\times L}$ is the eigenvector matrix as before, but taking only the first $L$ columns.  This technique has been widely used to reduce the dimension of large-dimensioned datasets by accounting for the directions of largest variance in the data, while neglecting the other directions.  In addition, this can also be used to remove noise from a dataset, in which it is assumed that the noise accounts for a small degree of variance, compared to the true underlying parameterization.  Finally, using PCA to find the 2 highest varying parameters can also allow us to visualize a high-dimensional dataset.  Let's do this now on the MNIST images.\n",

From this perspective, using the first 5, 10, 30, and 100 principle components is equivalent to compressing the data at a rate of 156:1, 78:1, 26:1, and 8:1, respectively.  By contrast, JPEG image compression can obtain compression ratios of 23:1 with reasonable image quality, surpassing the quality of reconstructions with PCA.  For that reason, PCA is not really used for image compression, but it has been used in a number of other fields, particularly in physics and engineering.\n"

    "## Autoencoders\n",
    "\n",
    "In this next part, we will devise a compression strategy using another method, autoencoders.  Autoencoders are neural networks which are trained to output their input in such a way that they learn a reduced dimensional space of the input distribution.  They are general composed of two distinct layers. The first encodes the input space (encoder) and the second decodes the encoded space back to the original feature space (decoder).  There are 3 basic types of autoencoders:\n",
    "1. __Undercomplete__ autoencoders work by constructing a network that has a hidden code layer that has fewer nodes than the input and output layers.  After training, the smaller hidden layer will represent an encoding of the input onto a lower dimensional space.\n",
    "2. __Regularized__ autoencoders use various regularization terms in the loss function during training to constrict the space of the output.  For example, sparse autoencoders add a sparsity regularization term in the loss to force as many nodes in the hidden layers to be zero.\n",
    "3. __Variational__ autoencoders work slightly differently than the previous two.  In this case, the autoencoder learns parameters that model the distribution of the input data in the encoder.  The decoder is then used to reconstruct the output based on a random sample from this distribution.  Some variational autoencoders have been used for image generation. \n",
